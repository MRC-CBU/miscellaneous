## [Power for Interactions](https://github.com/MRC-CBU/miscellaneous/tree/master/power-for-interactions)

**Is it *really* difficult to detect interactions**


There is a common perception that it is difficult to detect interactions (moderations) in multiple linear regression (MLR). There are several possible reasons for this, but a priori, the power for detecting an interaction is often equivalent to that for detecting a main effect, except in a few special cases, as demonstrated in the notebook and R Markdown code.
